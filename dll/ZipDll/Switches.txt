You only need to use this info if you will be tracing/modifying the
DLL source code.  Most BCB/Delphi programmers will NEVER need to know 
these switches!

IMPORTANT: Most of these switches have NO RELATIONSHIP to the 
switches used by PKZIP and PKUNZIP.  These switches, except for
some 'slight' changes, are the Info-Zip switches.

These switches are created in DLLMAIN.C and decoded in DLLZIP.C.
Note that my "-!" switch replaces the Info-Zip "-n" switch, because
I prefer to skip compression of already-compressed files by default.
Life is too short to waste time trying to compress ZIP files again!

zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyy] [zipfile] [list of fnames] [-xi list]

  -9 compression level is default
  The default action is to ADD or REPLACE zipfile entries from list.
  The default will save dirnames specified and recursed into.
      (to override saving of dirnames use: -j -D)

  -f   freshen: add only updated files that were already in ZIP
  -u   update: add only updated files, and any new files not already in ZIP
  -d   delete specified files from zipfile  
  -m   move files into zipfile (delete orig files after adding them)

  -k   force MSDOS (8+3) filenames
  -l   convert CRLF to LF (if this ZIP is heading for Unix) - NOT TESTED
       (this is lower-case L, not one!)
  -b   use \path\ for temp file

  -g   allow growing existing zipfile (must use this for Add)
  -r   recurse into subdirectories (like /S on XCOPY) 

  -0   store only (very fast, but no compression)
  -1   compress fastest (don't confuse "dash one" with "dash Lower-case L")
  -6   comprimize compression
  -9   compress best

  -q   quiet operation (disable all dialog output from DLL)
  -v   verbose operation (give us extra statistics)

  -t   only do files after \mmddyy\ { must have a null at end }
  -o   set zipfile datetime same as newest entry in the zipfile

  -D   do not add dirnames "by themselves" to the zipfile (they will 
       be by dflt).  
       Example: 
          args to ZIP Add:  \WINDOWS \CONFIG.SYS 
          With -D, this dirname: \WINDOWS won't be saved because it
          is given by itself (no filename with it).  If a filename is
          given with a dirname, then the "-j" switch is used to
          control whether or not it is saved.
            Also:  with recursion specified, all dirnames will be
          saved as separate entries, but the dirnames will also be 
          stored with the filenames.
  -j   junk dirnames (don't save dirnames of fspecs when you compress
       them)
       Example:
          args to ZIP: \DOS\ATTRIB.EXE  \WINDOWS\WIN.INI
          With -j, the dirnames of these files won't be saved along
          with the filenames.  Of course, the files will still be
          stored, but their names won't have dirnames with them.

  -J   junk .EXE suffix (self extract)
  -$   include volume label  
  -S   include system and hidden files

  -!   Override the non-compression of files with "special" suffixes
       This will make us try to compress every file, even those that
       appear to be already compressed.
  -e   encrypt

  -A   Adjust for SFX code (Always set)
  -b   temporary path, must be followed by a path. i.e. -b C:\Temp
  -X   Don't add extra fields
